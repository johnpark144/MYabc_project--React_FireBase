- Bundler : Webpack
- Explantion :
  This is English study website named 'MYabc' that I built to use usefully for those who need it including myself.
- Reason of creation :
  When I came to states for the first time, I found it hard to do everything due to language barrier.
  I remember how my English get improved going through many trials and errors, that is studying context of frequent word and sentences,
  and also checking meaning of words in English was helpfull a lot to feel the true meaning,
  that's why I used to use Eng/Eng Dictionary and Youglish site in bookmark in actuality.
  retrospecting that time, I came to think that would be good to develop the website or application for English study based on my experience.
  and put them into practice. and I will also create this in app when I learn React Native later on.
- Hard Part and Solution :

1. because of limit to call API a day, I used to fail to test after some time to test. so I've learn how to test effeciently
2. implementing Modal to do "delete or cancel", whenever I click "delete", sadly only last data had been deleted.. but I found solution that I put the Modal-making-component inside of the map-function that spread array. so now that I click to set the Modal, the Modal of that data to delete comes out.

- Things To Fix or Improve : need to get this clean code, better English-comment's grammer, Implement more function for better way of Engish study,
- Login Must ? : Yes (Sign-up or Oauth)
- Name why : "ABC" is begining of Alphabet but that sometimes indicate begining of English study so I named it MYabc
