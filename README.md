- Main Tools : React
- Sub Tools : Html, CSS(Tailwind CSS), Dictionary API, Youglish API, Grammarly API, FireBase
- Explantion :
This is English study website named 'MYabc' that I built to use usefully for those who need it including myself.
- Reason of creation :
When I came to states for the first time, I found it hard to do everything due to language barrier.
I remember how my English get improved going through many trials and errors, that is studying context of frequent word and sentences,
and also checking meaning of words in English was helpfull a lot to feel the true meaning,
that's why I used to use Eng/Eng Dictionary and Youglish site in bookmark in actuality.
retrospecting that time, I came to think that would be good to develop the website or application for English study based on my experience.
and put them into practice. and I will also create this in app when I learn React Native later on.
